<h1>Working with Cranky Op-Amps</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Many people these days get their introduction to audio electronics
by using docile op-amps like the Burr-Brown OPA132. This chip is
relatively slow at 8 MHz, which is fast enough to pass a low-distortion
audio signal, but not so fast that you can easily get into trouble.
Also, it has FET inputs, which means that you do not have to worry
about the value of the resistors around the op-amp affecting its
performance in surprising ways.</p>

<p>There are many other op-amps that are good for audio which are
raging tigers by comparison to the OPA132. I wrote the first version
of this article after trying to drop a National Semiconductor
LM617<i>x</i> into a <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/">CMoy pocket amp</a>. It
didn't work correctly at all. It oscillated like mad, and had high
DC offset at the headphone output. This article explains why these
two things happened, and what you can do to fix them. Along the
way, you will gain a greater understanding of “real”
op-amps, as opposed to the near ideal op-amp behavior exhibited by
docile chips like the OPA132. I use the LM617<i>x</i> as my prime example
simply because this chip is commonly used for audio, yet it's an
extreme mismatch to the stock CMoy design, so it illustrates the
problems clearly.  That said, the principles are relevant for a
great many other chips.</p>


<h3>High DC Offset</h3>

<h5>The Source of the Problem</h5>

<p>It's easiest to make integrated circuits using just one kind of
transistor. Traditional op-amps are made entirely of bipolar
transistors. (Plus some passive components.) The first really popular
IC op-amp was the µA741, introduced way back in 1968, yet still
available today. Take a look at the schematic on page 2 of the <a href="http://focus.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ua741.pdf">µA741 datasheet</a>,
and you'll see that each of the op-amp's input pins is connected
to a bipolar transistor's base. We say that this is a bipolar input
op-amp.</p>

<p>Why is this significant? One of the characteristics of a bipolar
transistor is that they require a small but substantial base current
to operate. This current either flows into or out of the op-amp's
inputs, and so forces a voltage across the resistors around the
op-amp. (Whether the current flows in or out depends on the structure
of the op-amp's input stage, but since a negative offset is just
as bad as a positive offset, we can ignore this fact.)</p>

<p>Now take a look at page 3 of the National Semiconductor LM617<i>x</i>
<a href="http://www.national.com/ds.cgi/LM/LM6171.pdf">
datasheet</a>.  There you will find a spec for “input bias
current,” which is this base current. For the LM617<i>x</i>, this
can be as high as <span class="nobreak">4 µA</span>. That's a pretty tiny current, but
consider what happens when you force this current across the
relatively high resistor values at a CMoy amp's inputs. Ohm's Law
tells us that if R2 is <span class="nobreak">100 kΩ</span>, forcing <span class="nobreak">4 µA</span> across it
will develop a voltage of 0.4 V. Hmm! Now we're talking about
something significant. Okay, what happens at the other input? From
the DC perspective, the resistance at a CMoy amp's inverting input
is R3 and R4 in parallel.  Using the default values of <span class="nobreak">1 kΩ</span>
and <span class="nobreak">10 kΩ</span>, the parallel resistance is <span class="nobreak">909 Ω</span>. If you force
<span class="nobreak">4 µA</span> across that, you get only <span class="nobreak">2.7 mV</span>. The offset at the
noninverting input is so much higher than at the inverting input
that it's close enough to the truth to say that there's 0.4 V of
DC offset at the CMoy amp's input with this configuration. When you
multiply that by the amp's gain, which is 11 in this instance, you
get 4.4 V at the op-amp's output. This much DC offset will kill
headphones very quickly.</p>

<p class="aside">(<b>Aside:</b> There are two other op-amp parameters
that also affect output offset voltage: input offset current and
input offset voltage. This article ignores those two because the
input bias current is the biggie in typical applications. Considering
the others wouldn't change the conclusions reached in this article.
If you want to know more about this topic, I recommend reading
section 11.3 of <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/elec/reviews/oae2.html">Op Amps for
Everyone</a>.  If you just want to know the total offset, use my
<a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/calc.html#offset">offset voltage calculator</a>.)</p>


<h5>Non-Solutions</h5>

<p>Obviously the amp's gain isn't helping here, but even if we lower
it to 1, we still have 0.4 V of offset. This is still way too high,
and lowering the gain to 1 probably isn't practical to boot. Most
of the time, we need at least <i>some</i> voltage gain in a headphone
amplifier.</p>

<p>We could add an output capacitor to block the DC, but the only
capacitors large enough to work in this situation are electrolytics.
Electrolytics are the absolute worst quality capacitors made. We
tolerate them only because for some things, they're the only thing
that will work. Only the most starry-eyed audiophile will tell you
that putting electrolytics in an audio signal path is a good idea,
if there is some other solution that will work.</p>

<p>We don't have to resort to such ham-handed hackery. We can take
a first big step by balancing the input bias currents.</p>


<h5>Balancing the Input Bias Currents</h5>

<p>If you assume that both op-amp inputs have the same input bias
current, the formula for balancing the input bias currents is just
the parallel resistor equation for two resistors. Using the part
names in the CMoy amplifier, the formula is:</p>

<p class="inset"><img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/cmoy-bias-bal-r2.gif" width="105" height="35" alt=""></p>

<p>This tells you what R2's value must be in order to null out the
DC offset, given the values of R3 and R4.</p>

<p>For your convenience, here's that same equation rearranged to
solve for R3 and R4:</p>

<p class="inset">
	<img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/cmoy-bias-bal-r3.gif" width="105" height="35" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/cmoy-bias-bal-r4.gif" width="105" height="35" alt="">
</p>

<p>Imagine what happens if we change R3 to <span class="nobreak">120 kΩ</span> and R4 to
<span class="nobreak">620 kΩ</span>. These two values in parallel are about <span class="nobreak">100.5 kΩ</span>,
which is about as close to R2's <span class="nobreak">100 kΩ</span> value as you're going
to get using the common 5% resistor values. Now the inverting input's
offset voltage rises to 0.40216 V. Subtracting that from the offset
at the noninverting input and multiplying by the new gain (6.2) you
get a tolerably low DC offset of <span class="nobreak">13 mV</span>. You could try for a
lower value by looking for R3/R4 values in the tighter 1% line to
get even closer to <span class="nobreak">100 kΩ</span>, but that quickly becomes a fool's
game. The actual input bias current will vary due to manufacturing
differences, and the two currents won't be identical. (This is what
the op-amp's input offset current spec tells you, by the way.) Also,
there are other sources of input-related DC offset that will
eventually swamp your efforts at fixing this one type. Finally,
even if you take care of everything else, resistor tolerances will
still prevent us from completely nulling the offset. In practice,
there are more effective ways to attack the remainder of this problem
than fine resistor matching.</p>

<p class="aside">(<b>Aside:</b> With that background, you're prepared
to understand one reason FET input op-amps exist: FETs do not have
this high base current. A FET input op-amp can have an input bias
current over a million times lower than an LM617<i>x</i>!  This is why
you do not have to worry about offset from imbalanced input bias
currents when using FET input op-amps in headphone amplifiers. The
consequence of this is that because it's harder to manufacture an
IC with two entirely different types of transistors, FET input
op-amps are more expensive than bipolar types, feature for feature.)</p>


<h5>New Problem 1: The Input Filter</h5>

<p>For me, the acceptable limit for DC offset in headphone amplifiers
is 20 mV, so 13 mV is fine. Unfortunately, the input bias current
isn't the only source of DC offset at the output of an op-amp. Add
in these other sources, and it's easily possible to go over this
limit. We need to lower the input bias current imbalance component
of the DC offset a bit more yet.</p>

<p>One way you might think to improve on this is to lower the
resistor values around the op-amp inputs. Let's do something drastic
and cut all three resistors in question to one tenth the values I
used above.  This cuts DC offset by a factor of 10, too.
<i>Voilá</i>, problem solved, right?</p>

<p>Well, yes, but you've just created a new problem.</p>

<p>In a CMoy amplifier, R2 and C2 form an RC high-pass filter. This
kind of filter passes high frequencies, and cuts low frequencies.
The most important number describing such a filter is its “corner
frequency.” For a high-pass filter, attenuation increases by
a steady 6 dB per octave below this frequency, and it flattens off
asymptotically toward zero above this point.  The corner frequency
happens to be the point where attenuation is 3 dB, so some people
will also call this “the -3 dB point,” but the actual
value isn't important in practice.</p>

<p>The formula for an RC filter's corner frequency is:</p>

<p class="inset"><img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/rc-filter.gif" width="76" height="34" alt=""></p>

<p>With the original CMoy values, the corner frequency is about 16
Hz.  So, the attenuation is 3 dB at 16 Hz, 9 dB one octave down at
8 Hz, 15 dB down at 4 Hz, etc. This shows another way to look at
the DC blocking nature of the CMoy amp's input capacitor: at DC,
this filter has infinite attenuation.</p>

<p>But we just decided to cut R2, R3, and R4 by a factor of 10 to
lower DC offset. What did we do to this filter? The corner frequency
is now 10 times higher, 160 Hz. We just completely destroyed the
amp's bass response! To get our filter characteristic back, we need
to raise the value of the input capacitor by the same factor as we
lowered the value of the resistors.</p>

<p>The standard input capacitor for the CMoy amp is <span class="nobreak">0.1 µF</span>,
so we need to go up to <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span>. <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span> audiophile-quality
capacitors exist, so this is doable. But as I describe in the article
<i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/input-cap.html">Input Capacitors for Headphone Amps</a></i>, <span class="nobreak">0.1 µF</span> is just barely sufficient
to begin with. If you follow the advice in that article, you'd want
to use a <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span> capacitor with Chu Moy's original R2 value. This
implies going up to a <span class="nobreak">10 µF</span> input cap in this new resistor
configuration. Film caps this large do exist, but they're expensive
and hard to find in DIYer quantities.  Furthermore, if it's physically
small it will be low quality, or if it's good for audio it will be
so large that it probably won't fit in your amp's enclosure to begin
with.</p>


<h5>New Problem 2: Input Loading</h5>

<p>It just isn't practical to go over about <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span> for headphone
amp input capacitors if audio quality is your primary goal. Indeed,
your choice of capacitor line and physical layout issues may force
you to a <span class="nobreak">0.47 µF</span> or lower value capacitor. We need to find a
better way to fix this DC offset problem.</p>

<p>You might choose to embrace this constraint instead of complaining
about it. Instead of trying to get DC offset to vanishingly low
levels, let's just try to get DC offset a little lower than our
<span class="nobreak">20 mV</span> threshold value. We'll only cut the resistor values in
half, and double the size of the input cap. Since compromise is the
game of the day here, we won't try to find a good <span class="nobreak">2 µF</span> capacitor,
but instead settle for <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span>, or maybe even <span class="nobreak">0.47 µF</span>.  It
isn't perfect, but it's not bad.</p>

<p>But now we have another new problem. By cutting the R2 value in
half, we're now “loading” the volume pot, if we have
one. The general rule of thumb in this piece of the electronics
world is that a source should have an impedance at least  10×
lower than its load. In the CMoy design, Chu Moy recommended
<span class="nobreak">100 kΩ</span> for R2 because he also recommended a <span class="nobreak">10 kΩ</span> volume
control. If we cut R2 in half, we have to cut the pot's value in
half, too. Problem is, there are no good <span class="nobreak">5 kΩ</span> audio pots to
speak of. Even if we could find one, the 10× loading rule
applies for the pot as well: it's the load for the audio source.
It's not unheard of for audio sources to have output impedances as
high as <span class="nobreak">1 kΩ</span>. For many years, <span class="nobreak">600 Ω</span> was the most common
output impedance value.  This is why <span class="nobreak">10 kΩ</span> is the lowest common
audio pot value.</p>


<h5>New Problem 3: Resistor Noise</h5>

<p>All resistors generate noise, proportionally to the resistor's value.
This is called Johnson noise (after its discoverer), and the formula for
it is this:</p>

<p class="inset"><img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/johnson-noise.gif" width="107" height="18" alt=""></p>

<p>where <i>k</i> is Boltzmann's constant (1.38 × 10<sup>-23</sup>),
<i>T</i> is the temperature of the resistor (in Kelvins), <i>R</i>
is the resistor value, and <i>B</i> is the bandwidth over which you
want to calculate the noise. So for instance, the noise of a <span class="nobreak">1 kΩ</span>
resistor at room temperature (300 °K is a nice round number,
and close enough) will generate 575 nV of noise over the audio
bandwidth (20 Hz to 20 kHz):</p>

<p class="inset">
	<img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/jnoise-ex1.gif" width="307" height="25" alt=""><br>
	<img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/jnoise-ex2.gif" width="131" height="25" alt=""><br>
	<img src="./Working with Cranky Op-Amps_files/jnoise-ex3.gif" width="118" height="17" alt=""><br>
</p>

<p>This is a property of all conductors, due to thermal effects.
(It is also called thermal noise, because of this.) The higher the
resistor value, and the higher the temperature, the higher the
noise. (You can read more about the phenomenon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson-Nyquist_noise">here</a>. You
can play with the numbers using my <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/calc.html#noise">op-amp
noise calculator</a>.)</p>

<p>You can see the problem, then: by going with <span class="nobreak">120 kΩ</span> and
<span class="nobreak">620 kΩ</span> feedback resistors above, we've increased the circuit
noise. Is it a big enough difference to matter? The proposed circuit
will have only a -80 dB noise floor relative to a 1V signal, and
that ignores the noise contribution from the op-amp itself, and any
noise from the source. That's pretty quiet, but audible. The stock
CMoy configuration (adjusting to get the same gain) has a noise
floor 7 dB lower, which is enough to be perceived as significantly
quieter.</p>


<h5>Solutions</h5>

<p>Okay, so both the pot and the input cap mean we can't lower R2,
which forces R3 and R4 to be high in order to balance the input bias
currents. Have we completely painted ourselves into a corner?
Fortunately, no.</p>

<p>A single-channel op-amp really only requires 5 pins, but we put them
in 8-pin packages for historical reasons.  Frequently, IC designers will
use two of these pins for a DC offset nulling feature. If your chip has
such a feature, it's possible for it to trim out small errors. How you
use this feature and how large an error it can fix are very much chip
dependent. Read its datasheet.</p>

<p>If you're using a dual-channel op-amp, all 8 pins are required
just for the core op-amp functions, so you can't use that method. And,
sometimes you just cannot afford trim pots for one reason or another.
All is not lost.</p>

<p>Another possible fix is to simply avoid bipolar chips with high
input bias current. All the major op-amp manufacturers these days offer
parametric search engines, where you can specify the maximum input bias
current that your design can tolerate. Perhaps you can find an alternate
chip that will work. Even better, many times there is a high-grade
version of the chip you want to use. Almost always, the entire advantage
to these high-grade op-amps is in better DC specs. That may be enough
to save your design.</p>

<p>If all that fails, you might start questioning the constraints
you've placed on yourself. Do you really need that input capacitor?
In <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/input-cap.html">another article</a>, I argue that it's
often more trouble than it's worth. So let's say we decide that the
input cap isn't pulling its own weight. What happens if we remove
it? Well, at DC, we now have two resistances in parallel on the
noninverting input: the pot and R2. Since the pot's resistance is
so much lower than the value of R2, it dominates. This lower value
on the noninverting input means we can get away with lower resistor
values in the feedback loop. Lower values mean lower DC offsets,
and as a side bonus, lower circuit noise. The only trick here is,
the pot is a variable resistance. That means DC offset will vary
as you turn the volume knob. Depending on the chip you're using,
this may be harmless, or it could mean that there are volume settings
where DC offset rises to harmful levels. You will have to <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/calc.html#offset">crunch the numbers</a> to find out if this
will work.</p>


<h5>The Bottom Line</h5>

<p>The amp's gain and the values of the pot, input cap, input
resistor, and gain resistors all interact with each other. Lowering
any of the resistor values requires that the other two be lowered
by the same factor to keep all else equal. That in turn means that
the input cap has to be <i>raised</i> by that same factor. Meanwhile,
the pot must remain at least 10× lower in value than the input
resistor. You'll frequently find that changing one value means the
required change in one or more of the others is impractical. This
careful balancing act is the soul of engineering. There are no truly
perfect solutions in engineering, only holistically acceptable
collections of compromises.</p>


<h3>Oscillation</h3>

<h5>Why It Happens</h5>

<p>Take a look at the CMoy pocket amp <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/misc/cmoy-tangent-sch.pdf">schematic</a>. It's so simple. The
voltage from the pot is presented at the op-amp's noninverting input,
the feedback resistors tell the op-amp how much gain you want, and the
op-amp puts out what you gave it magnified by that gain. So
straightforward and neat. Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if that's how
things worked in the real world!</p>

<p>In a real circuit, current doesn't just go from A to B, following
the traces laid down on the printed circuit board. Some of it goes
<i>across</i> the surface of the circuit board instead, because the
surface is never 100% clean. Since PCB material isn't a perfect
insulator, some also goes through the PCB material. Current finds
other sneak paths past your feedback loop, too, such as nonzero
power and ground impedances, parasitic components in the feedback
loop, etc. And those are the easy ones. If things are really getting
weird, you have still other paths, like RFI through the air.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It all comes down to op-amp action and
phase shift.</p>

<p>The thing that makes an op-amp an op-amp is that it always tries
to make its two inputs have an equal voltage. We call this op-amp
action. The purpose of adding resistors and such in the feedback
loop is to modify this op-amp action.</p>

<p>Let's see how op-amp action works to produce voltage gain.  Imagine
that we have 0.1 V at the amplifier's noninverting input.  Imagine then
that this voltage goes straight through the op-amp completely untouched:
we get 0.1 V at the output. This voltage goes around the feedback loop,
which contains a simple voltage divider in an amplifier like the CMoy
pocket amp. For the sake of argument, let's say it's a 10× voltage
divider. Our 0.1 V signal is reduced to 0.01 V by this divider. The
op-amp wants to make its -IN voltage equal to its +IN voltage, so it
raises its output voltage by a factor of 10. Now the output is 1.0 V,
which is divided down to 0.1 V by the feedback loop resistors, so the
op-amp is happy.  We have voltage gain.</p>

<p>Now imagine some force comes along — its nature doesn't
matter here — and forces the op-amp's output voltage down a
smidge. Through the feedback loop, this forces the inverting input
down, too. The op-amp sees that the inverting input is trying to
go lower than the noninverting input, so again op-amp action comes
into play, forcing the output upward to counteract our mystery
force. This is why op-amps have such low distortion and low output
impedance when operating in their normal range. Op-amp action forces
corrective measures to be taken any time there is a deviation from
the expected behavior. The only reason op-amps have distortion at
all is that we cannot create perfect op-amp action in the real
world.</p>

<p>Okay, so what about the real world, then? Let's imagine what
happens if our amplifier is presented with a sine wave instead of
a simple DC voltage. Let's also say there is some delay in the
circuitry within the amplifier, such that it shifts the sine wave
by 180 degrees as it goes through the op-amp. In a sine wave, 180
degrees of shift reverses the voltage: 2 V becomes -2 V, -0.3 V
becomes 0.3 V, etc. Let's say that the sine wave has 1 V peaks, and
that a positive peak is at the amplifier's input. Due to the delay
within the op-amp, that means that the output is only now putting
out what happened 180 degrees ago, which is -1 V. For now, we'll
ignore gain and put -1 at the inverting input, too.  The two inputs
are unequal, so op-amp action kicks in to try and correct it. The
noninverting input is higher than the inverting input, so the op-amp
tries to raise its output voltage a smidge. But because there is
180 degrees of phase shift, this actually results in the output
going <i>down</i> by a smidge instead! We have a self-reinforcing
cycle called “positive feedback” that forces the output
voltage hard one direction, and then because of real world limits
it must go back the other way as fast as it can. The cycle repeats
endlessly.  Congratualations, you have created an oscillator.</p>

<p>So obviously it would be Really Bad<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup>
to make an op-amp with 180 degrees of phase shift. But in the real
world, we cannot make an op-amp with 0 degrees of phase shift.  Real
op-amps always have some phase shift. The difference between the
amount of phase shift and 180 degrees is called the op-amp's phase
margin. If nothing else in your circuit adds a delay, you can get
away with 0.0001 degrees of phase margin. But life isn't that simple,
of course. Remember all those sneak paths I listed above that avoid
your carefully planned negative feedback loop? If conditions are
right, any of these can set up a positive feedback loop and create
an oscillator.</p>

<p>In a real op-amp, phase shift varies depending on frequency.
Since real signals like music are composed of many wanted frequencies
plus unwanted ones like noise, the way a circuit reacts to a signal
can be very complex. A circuit can operate without any oscillation
in some circumstances, but if just the right frequency enters into
the circuit, it can take off into oscillation.</p>

<p>As a rule, the faster an op-amp is, the less phase margin it
will have. Furthermore, wider bandwidth means there are a greater
range of signals that the op-amp pays attention to. If you present
an 8 MHz amplifier with 21 MHz noise, it's more or less going to
ignore it.  But if you present that same noise to a 220 MHz op-amp,
it will amplify it right along with the rest of your signal. If
that magnified noise happens to be of just the right frequency to
trigger oscillation, your choice to use a faster chip will be
fateful.</p>


<h5>How to Fix It, Part 1: Power Supply Bypassing</h5>

<p>An ideal power supply has zero impedance. Ohm's Law (V=IR) tells
us that if impedance (R) is zero, no amount of current (I) can
possibly force a change in the power supply's voltage (V). It would
be a perfect voltage source. The same goes for your ground: no
amount of current dumped to a perfect ground changes the ground
voltage.</p>

<p>In the real world, the power supply and ground always have a
nonzero impedance. We try to get as close to zero as possible, but
it is not possible to construct a perfect voltage source. This means
that your circuit's varying current draw sets up tiny voltage ripples
in the power and ground signals. It's easy to see why the stability
of the ground path matters: in a CMoy amp, the op-amp's -IN input
is connected to ground through R3, so if ground is bouncing, it's
like a phantom signal appearing at -IN. As for the power rails, an
op-amp doesn't have infinite power supply rejection ratio, so some
ripple on the power rails makes it into the op-amp's output, and
so can cause oscillation.  (See the companion article
<i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamp-ps.html">Op-Amp Power Supply Quality Considerations</a></i> for more on such topics.)</p>

<p>One way to lower the power and ground impedances is to add bypass
capacitors. Capacitors are energy storage devices. When you place
them in parallel with a power circuit, the capacitor tries to smooth
out any ripples in that circuit. The art of using bypass capacitors
is subtle, however. You can't just throw a bunch of caps on the
board and expect all the oscillations to go away. The reasons are
complex.</p>

<p>First, the opposite of capacitance is inductance, and all wires
have inductance. Making wires shorter and thicker reduces inductance,
but it has practical limits. Because inductance counteracts
capacitance, too much wire between a bypass capacitor and what it
is supposed to be bypassing will render that cap ineffective.
Therefore, a bypass capacitor should go as close to the device being
bypassed as possible. For critical work, you must even consider the
length of the capacitor's lead.  This is one reason why surface
mount technology has become so popular: surface mount ceramic
capacitors have essentially zero lead length (hence little inductance)
and can sit extremely close to whatever they need to bypass.  That
multi-gigahertz computer on your desktop wouldn't be possible without
the miniaturization afforded by surface mount technology. You simply
could not build the same circuit twice the size and have it work:
the extra  wire length alone would prevent it from working.</p>

<p>The most popular bypass capacitors are <span class="nobreak">0.1 µF</span> ceramics. For
op-amp audio circuits, it's best to add two per op-amp, one from
each power rail to ground. The leg going to ground can be as long
as it needs to be; get the other leg as close to the power pin as
possible. Because the effectiveness of capacitors for bypassing
relative to frequency goes up as the value goes down, you may need
to go down to <span class="nobreak">0.01 µF</span> for faster op-amps. You can also use
film capacitors instead of ceramics. Ceramics are better at high
frequency, but films have higher linearity, which makes audiophiles
happy. The linearity is of no value if the circuit doesn't work
because the bypass capacitor is ineffective at the problem frequency,
however, so don't rule out ceramics. A nice compromise is the C0G
or NP0 type ceramic, which has nearly as high a linearity as a film
cap but has the high speed advantages of a ceramic.</p>

<p>Also helpful can be some larger tantalum capacitors. They don't
handle the higher frequency noises, so they don't have to be as
close to the chip as the ceramics. As with the ceramics, it's better
in analog circuits to use two caps from ground, one going to each
power rail. But, you might get away with using just one from rail
to rail. Values somewhere in the <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span> to <span class="nobreak">10 µF</span> range work
best. You can let one big tant (or a pair of them) serve several
ICs.  Bigger is better, especially if each IC doesn't have its own
tant(s), but don't get crazy. A <span class="nobreak">2.2 µF</span> bypass cap might serve
just as well as a <span class="nobreak">10 µF</span> in a situation where <span class="nobreak">1 µF</span> would
be insufficient.</p>


<h5>How to Fix It, Part 2: Bandwidth Limiting</h5>

<p>You'll recall that one of the factors increasing the risk of
oscillation is excess bandwidth.</p>

<p>If you listen to hard-assed electrical engineers, they'll tell
you that even the lowly µA741 is good enough for audio. They're
right that it has enough bandwidth, and sufficient slew rate to
pass a decent audio signal, as long as you don't load it down too
heavily. But if you listen to your headphones instead of those
engineers, you will hear something very different: the µA741 sucks
for audio!</p>

<p>When we use a modern high-speed op-amp like the 100 MHz LM617<i>x</i>
for audio, it's not because we need to amplify signals beyond the
20 kHz audio bandwidth or because we need unholy fast slew rates.
What we're more after are things like the chip's higher precision and
its ability to drive low impedance loads. Chips with a wide closed-loop
bandwidth also tend to have a wide region of flat open-loop bandwidth,
which means the feedback factor is linear over a wider range of the audio
bandwidth. These and other features add up to lower distortion in that
critical lower 20 kHz.</p>

<p>It's possible to have our cake and eat it, too.  If you drop a small
capacitor across the feedback resistor (R4 in most of the amps discussed
on this site), the gain of the amp starts dropping as the frequency
rises. (You can use the RC filter equation above to determine this
filter's -3 dB point.) Since voltage gain is almost always a factor
in the onset of oscillation, this bandwidth limiting cap — also
called a phase lead cap — can cure oscillation.</p>

<p>Let's work an example. Say your R4 is <span class="nobreak">620 kΩ</span>. Let's try a
<span class="nobreak">10 pF</span> bandwidth limiting cap. The RC filter formula above tells us
that the op-amp will be acting like an RC filter with a corner frequency
of about 26 kHz with these values. (In other words, the amp's gain is
reduced by 3 dB from its nominal value at 26 kHz.) That's not far above
the audio bandwidth, so we might choose a slightly smaller cap value,
or we might somehow finagle smaller resistor values to allow us to use
a larger cap value. Putting the corner frequency somewhere in the 30
kHz to 100 kHz range is probably best.</p>

<p>Since this cap is directly in the audio path, quality matters.
The absolute best caps for audio use are polypropylenes, but the
smallest I've ever seen are <span class="nobreak">33 pF</span>, and those are hard to get.
Next best are polystyrenes, which are made in all values suitable
for this purpose, but they, too, are hard to get.  The third best
choice isn't bad at all, and they're pretty easy to find: silver
mica. If you cannot get those, or you cannot afford the board space
they take, there's only one level lower you should ever go here:
you can use NP0 or C0G ceramic capacitors. (These two types are the
same.) Never use any other ceramic type in the audio path. Never,
never, never. Change the circuit another way to avoid oscillation
before you break down and use, say, an X7R ceramic in the audio path.
Only film types and NP0/C0G ceramics are linear enough for high
quality audio.</p>

<p>There is an important situation where a bandwidth limiting cap
will make things worse instead of better. Because a bandwidth cap
rolls off the amp's gain toward 1 at high frequencies, it doesn't
work correctly with op-amps that aren't unity gain stable. For
instance, the NE5534 requires a gain of at least 3 to be stable.
Using a bandwidth limiting cap with such an op-amp will frequently
create an oscillator.</p>


<h5>How to Fix It, Part 3: Things to Try Before Resorting to Voodoo</h5>

<p>If the op-amp still oscillates, try these things, in this order:</p>

<ul><ol>
	<li>Add a small resistor to the op-amp's output, either inside
	or outside the feedback loop. (<span class="nobreak">10-100 Ω</span>) This isolates the
	op-amp from any load capacitance. I prefer putting it inside the
	feedback loop, because op-amp feedback will counteract some of
	the bad effects of having the resistor, yet the resistor will
	remain effective. Others recommend putting it outside the loop,
	so that it can protect both the OUT and the -IN op-amp pins. This
	raises the amplifier's output impedance, though, which is not
	without consequences.

	<p>
	</p></li><li>Do the same as in the previous step, except use a ferrite
	bead or chip ferrite instead of the resistor. At low frequencies,
	the resistance of a ferrite is basically that of the wire going
	through it. The resistance rises as frequency rises, and it's
	at high frequency that oscillation usually occurs. Thus, you
	get the output resistance you need at the oscillation frequency,
	while having very low resistance at audio frequencies. This can
	make it more palatable to put the ferrite outside the feedback
	loop; with standard ferrite beads, it's easy to just put a bead
	around each wire going to the output jack. I make an exception
	when using chip ferrites, since the small wires used in them
	make the DC resistance significant; therefore, I only use them
	inside the feedback loop, so feedback can remove its effect at
	low frequencies.

	<p>
	</p></li><li>Raise the amp's gain a bit. Unlike the feedback capacitor
	trick, this truly limits the bandwidth of the op-amp. If
	you look in your op-amp's datasheet, you'll find a spec
	called “gain-bandwidth product” (GBP). This
	spec comes from the fact that gain and bandwidth have a
	linear relationship in an ideal op-amp, such that multiplying
	gain by bandwidth always equals the GBP.  (Practical op-amps
	have nonlinearities in their gain and bandwidth relations,
	so there is usually a graph of the actual gain vs. bandwidth
	curve in the datasheet.)

	<p>
	</p></li><li>If you have control of the circuit board's layout, it may be
	possible to improve the layout enough to fix the oscillation. Tips
	on improving your layout are beyond the scope of this article,
	however.

	<p>
	</p></li><li>If you're using a socket, solder the op-amp chip directly
	to the board instead. This lowers parasitic inductance, so
	the bypass caps work better. It also reduces the parasitic
	capacitance between the op-amp inputs, which can also be a cause
	of oscillation.

	<p>
	</p></li><li>Add a buffer inside the op-amp's feedback loop. (See Figure
	4 in the <a href="http://www-s.ti.com/sc/ds/buf634.pdf">BUF634
	datasheet</a> for an example of this.) This relieves the load
	on the op-amp, which helps most significantly by increasing the
	op-amp's phase margin. Buffers also tend to be better at dealing
	with capacitive loads than op-amps. A long headphone cable can
	easily have <span class="nobreak">1000 pF</span> of shunt capacitance, which is well
	beyond the recommended load range for most op-amps.
