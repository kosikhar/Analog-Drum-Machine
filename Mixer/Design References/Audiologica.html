<h4>Getting Started in Headphone DIY</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/new-diyer.html">Getting Started in Audio DIY</a></i> — If you are thinking about
  getting into audio DIY, this article tells you what tools and such
  you will need. It includes recommended tools’ part numbers
  and more.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/ampweaksource.html">Is Amplifying Low-End Sources Worthwhile?</a></i> — Discusses the
  tradeoffs in adding a headphone amp to a system with a low-end
  source. Is a chain only as strong as its weakest link?</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/">How to Build the CMoy Pocket Headphone Amplifier</a></i> — This is a tutorial on
  building Chu Moy’s pocket headphone amplifier. This is an
  excellent choice for your first DIY audio project.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/pancomp.html">How to Wire Panel Components</a></i> — Now that you’ve got
  your amplifier circuit assembled, you need to wire up the switches,
  knobs, and jacks. This article will help you figure out which wire
  goes where.</p>


<h4>Building a Better Amp</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/pimeta2/">The PIMETA v2 Headphone Amplifier</a></i> — This design is intended
  primarily for compact portable amplifiers, though it can scale up
  easily. The circuit topology is closest to that of the <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/ppa/amp2/">PPA v2</a>, without quite as many bells and whistles.
  If you want an inexpensive amp that’s easier to put together
  than any of the others mentioned below, this is the one for you.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/ppa/">The PPA Project</a></i> — The PPA is a high-end
  headphone amplifier that works for both stationary and
  “transportable” amplifiers. There is a companion
  fast-charging NiMH battery board design, allowing excellent sonics
  without sacrificing run time despite the PPA amp’s hunger for
  power. While only the most dedicated audiophile would take it jogging
  with their iPod, this combination makes for a fine travel amplifier.
  Back at home, you can continue running on the battery supply to get
  better sound than wall power allows. Or, you can forego the battery
  supply entirely: the PPA works fine in a purely stationary
  configuration with a regular wall supply.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/dist-amp.html">How Do I Make a Distribution Amplifier?</a></i> — Many people coming to my site
  actually want to drive several headphones at once, and wind up asking
  me how they can make one of the above designs do that. That’s
  called a distribution amp, and I discuss your easiest options in this
  article, and hint at some of the more complex ones, too.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/wall-ps.html">Where Can I Get a Wall Power Supply for My Amp?</a></i> — While all of the amps on this
  site will work with battery power supplies of one sort or another,
  many people want to run them from wall power instead. The amps on this
  site are somewhat particular about what types work well with them,
  however, and good choices aren’t always easy to find. Rather
  than describe the options repeatedly on each amp’s section,
  I’ve begun to collect the general advice here.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/mlxfeed.html">Modified Linkwitz Crossfeed</a></i> — This is my take on Chu
  Moy’s crossfeed circuit.</p>


<h4>Op-Amps in Detail</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamps.html">Notes on Audio Op-Amps</a></i> — My thoughts on various
  low-power op-amps useful in DIY audio equipment.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/hs-opamp.html">Working with Cranky Op-Amps</a></i> — Some op-amps are just plain
  cranky, and making them work correctly requires special care. I
  wrote this article after playing with the NatSemi LM617x, but it
  applies to other fast bipolar-input op-amps.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamp-ps.html">Op-Amp Power Supply Quality Considerations</a></i> — The power quality you give
  to an op-amp affects the output. This article discusses the issues
  as they relate to using op-amps for audio amplification.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamp-wv.html">Op-Amp Working Voltage Considerations</a></i> — Calculating the power supply
  voltage you need to give an op-amp to power a set of headphones
  requires a certan amount of care, as the issue is complex.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/opamp-bias.html">Biasing Op-Amps into Class A</a></i> — Describes various methods
  of biasing an op-amp into class A to reduce distortion.</p>


<h4>Passive Components Matter, Too</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/input-cap.html">Input Capacitors for Headphone Amps</a></i> — Explains the issues
  surrounding input capacitors in headphone amps.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/resmatch.html">Hand-Matching Resistors to Tighter Tolerances</a></i> — Explains what you need to
  know and what equipment you need in order to hand-match resistor
  pairs to arbitrarily high tolerances.  This is useful for reducing
  mismatches between the channels in a stereo audio circuit.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/atten.html">Notes on Audio Attenuators</a></i> — Research and comments on
  pots and stepped attenuators for audio DIY.</p>


<h4>Testing</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/trouble.html">Basic Troubleshooting for Headphone Amplifiers</a></i> — If your amp doesn’t
  work, this article may guide you to the solution.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/hp-dummy.html">Making a Headphone Dummy Load</a></i> — No headphone amplifier test
  is complete without a full load test. You could use real headphones,
  but a strenuous test can destroy them, and it’s hard to
  compare results made with real headphones. A dummy load avoid both
  problems. This article shows how easy it is to build one.</p>


<h4>Other Stuff</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/elec/">Electronics Pages</a></i> — The more
  general electronics stuff on my site is here. Most of the stuff
  there applies to audio electronics, but it isn’t about audio
  <i>per se</i>. Many of the articles that once were on this page have
  been moved there, including some of the power supply articles.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/calc.html">Electronics Calculators</a></i> — Some simple online
  calculators useful when building audio circuits.</p>


<h4>Obsolete Amplifier Designs</h4>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/pimeta/">The PIMETA v1 Headphone Amplifier</a></i> — The original PIMETA,
  predecessor to the <a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/pimeta2/">PIMETA v2</a>.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/"></a></i> — The PINT was the same basic
  circuit as the PIMETA, but without separate output buffers and packed
  down into a board that’s smaller than a stick of gum. It could
  fit along with two <span class="nobreak">9 V</span> batteries in a standard mint tin.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/mint/">The MINT Headphone Amplifier</a></i> — The MINT was the predecessor
  to the PINT. The board was bigger because it used more through-hole
  parts and had more chips on the board.</p>

  <p><i><a href="https://tangentsoft.net/audio/meta42/">The META42 Headphone Amplifier</a></i> — The META42 was the
  predecessor to the MINT and the PIMETA.</p>
